This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

### Pre-commit hooks

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically run TypeScript type checking before commits.

To set up pre-commit hooks (one-time setup for new developers):

```bash
# Install pre-commit (if not already installed)
brew install pre-commit

# Install the hooks
pre-commit install
```

The hooks will now run automatically on every commit. To run them manually:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
